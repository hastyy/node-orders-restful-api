 * Schema.methods is a special property of Schema where we can register
 * functions as methods to be available in the instances of the model using
 * this schema.
 * In this case we must use the regular function syntax instead of an arrow
 * function because of the 'this' reference binding. If we used an arrow
 * function, 'this' would point to the global object. Using a regular function,
 * 'this' points to the Model instance (user) calling the method. To avoid
 * confusion throughout the method logic, we initially assign 'this' to a more
 * evident constant 'user'. 'user' will replace 'this' in our logic.
 * 
 * This method generates an authentication token to the user document/account on
 * which we are calling this method.
 * The token generated is a JSON Web Token. A JWT string is composed of three
 * different parts, each separated by a '.', and these are:
 *  1. Header: contains information such as the hashing algorithm used to
 *      produce the token.
 *  2. Payload: contains the data object we embed on the token. This should
 *      identify who's making the request.
 *  3. Signature/Hash: Is the resulting string from applying the hashing
 *      algorithm specified on the Header to the resulting raw string of
 *      concatenating:
 *          - the Payload
 *          - a secret string that only the server knows
 * The Header and the Payload are publicly viewable data, they are not
 * encrypted in any way. To prove this we can insert a generated JWT in the
 * encoded box on https://jwt.io/ to see the decoded representation.
 * Technically a malicious agent could alter the payload data to identify itself
 * as someone else. This isn't possbible though because as said above, the
 * Signature is generated through the concatenation of the Payload and some
 * secret. To make this kind of attack work, the malicious agent would have to
 * alter the Payload and the Signature aswell in order for them to match. But
 * the agent can't do that because he doesn't know the secret.
 * 
 * Method implementation:
 * Data is an object that contains the user information we want to be exchanging
 * back and forth with the client, so that they can indentify themselves when
 * making a request. This will be (part of) the token payload.
 * We use jwt.sign() to generate a token, passing to it the data that identifies
 * the user and the secret to sign the token.
 * Having the token, we push it to the tokens array on the user document and
 * save the document back to the database.
 * We wait for the save() to return successfully and then return the token.
 * 
 * We aren't using a try/catch block because if an error is thrown we don't want
 * to catch it here. The best behaviour is to set the app in the path of sending
 * a 500 Internal Server Error to the client.

/**
 * Register Mongoose middleware to run before (pre) a save event on the User
 * collection.
 * Here we hash the users password before saving the document to the database.
 * To hash the password we take two steps:
 *  - generate a salt to combine with the provided password in order for it to
 *      represent a (much) less evident value. Here we have to assume that the
 *      user provides a weak password like an english word and if we hashed this
 *      password exactly as it is and save it to the database, it would be
 *      vulnerable against hash look-up tables. If we hash 'icecreamsdfs'
 *      instead of icecream, we have (much) better chances to be protected
 *      against those.
 *  - hash the password using the generated salt value
 * To generate the salt we call bcrypt.genSalt(). The first argument is the
 * number of rounds it should take to generate the salt. This is already slow
 * by itself but the bigger the number of rounds, the slower it will get. We
 * could increment this number in order to prevent bruteforce attacks but by
 * increasing it we are slowing down our api. 10 is a fairly reasonable number.
 * This functions calls a callback when it finishes, passing the generated salt
 * value.
 * Then we call bcrypt.hash() that takes the plaintext password, the salt value
 * and a callback that will be called with the hashed password when hash()
 * finishes. The hashed value we get from .hash() (in the callback) also stores
 * a lot of useful information inside of the generated hash string, like the
 * number of rounds used and the salt. For this, there's no reason to have both
 * the password and the salt stored in the database: the password is enough. It
 * is important to store the salt because it is generated solely for this one
 * password, so bcrypt will need it to compare the hash with the plaintext
 * password later (in logging in, for instance).
 * Before we hash the password though, we have to check if we are modifying the
 * password field from 'this' user instance in this save() operation. If we are,
 * we must indeed hash the (new) password. If we are editing the user but not
 * changing the password, the bcrypt logic must not run because otherwise we
 * will be hashing the already hashed password in the database. The
 * isModified(<field>) method on model instances tell us if a given field was
 * modified since we fetched the user from the database. If we just created it
 * and are about to save it, every field will be flagged as modified, hence we
 * will always hash the passwords of the newly created users.
 * Since this is a middleware we must call next().
 * 
 * In this case we must use the regular function syntax instead of an arrow
 * function because of the 'this' reference binding. If we used an arrow
 * function, 'this' would point to the global object. Using a regular function,
 * 'this' points to the Model instance (user) calling the save() method. 
 * To avoid confusion throughout the method logic, we initially assign 'this' to
 * a more evident constant 'user'. 'user' will replace 'this' in our logic.
